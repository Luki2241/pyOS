Presenting pyOS!!! 
An OS simulator made entirely in python where you can make files, folders and text files!
It's small right now, but maybe the guy or girl whos reading this can make it bigger! 
I would really appreciate it and if  you do, just send me the files on my discord profile! Its in my bio.
