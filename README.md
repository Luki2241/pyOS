Presenting pyOS!!! 
An OS simulator made entirely in python where you can make files, folders and text files!
It's small right now, but maybe the guy or girl whos reading this can make it bigger! 
I would really appreciate it and if  you do, just send me the files on my discord profile! Its in my bio.
Btw guys ik youre probably thinking: bro you copied the name of other projects like this! And no
i didnt do that i just didnt know what name to put and i just realized there are other projects with the same name.
